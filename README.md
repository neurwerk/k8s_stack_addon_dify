# Neurwerk Dify addon

This repository owns the Dify Community Edition charts, release stages, and
the API and Web overlay images. The client selects this optional package as a
separate Git source; Base provides shared PostgreSQL and identity services.
Image builds are interactive and workstation-operated because the images are
too large for the hosted CI path. CI validates source provenance, checksums,
shell code, and formatting; it never builds or publishes images.
`make check` also renders the charts and release packages.

The canonical repository is
[`neurwerk/k8s_stack_addon_dify`](https://github.com/neurwerk/k8s_stack_addon_dify).

## Package layout

- `charts/dify/`: application components and Dify OIDC registration.
- `releases/namespaces/dify/`: Dify namespace.
- `releases/dify/secret-sync/`: namespace-local OpenBao credential delivery.
- `releases/dify/oidc/`: OIDC reconciliation.
- `releases/dify/app/`: application releases and non-secret defaults.

The release files use `GitRepository/dify-addon` in `flux-system`. The client
supplies the source at an exact commit, namespace-local values, and ordered
Flux stages. This is a staged package, **not an installable add-on yet**:
database, roles, approval, and managed-key stages still need the agreed Base
interfaces, and the application charts still pin the verified legacy GHCR
API/Web digests. Do not select it until those stages are complete, the new
API and Web image names have been published and verified, the chart pins have
been updated, and client dependencies have been validated. No Dify instance is
running.

See [installation](docs/installation.md) for the staged package boundaries and
[operations](docs/operations.md) for validation and future health checks.

## What It Changes

- Adds Keycloak OIDC authentication and sign-in UI integration.
- Uses Dify's upstream PostgreSQL 18-compatible UUID migration and OAuth service;
  retains the retry-safe concurrent-index migration.
- Adds single-workspace model-provider bootstrap behavior.
- Bundles a checksum-pinned, unmodified Dify OpenAI-compatible plugin package.

`customizations/scripts/patch_dify.py` applies guarded changes to the pinned upstream
API and Web sources. `customizations/api/neurwerk_settings.py` extends configuration,
and `customizations/api/neurwerk_sso.py` integrates Keycloak with upstream's OAuth
application service. See
`NOTICE-CHANGES.md` for the change inventory and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for
license and provenance details.

## Version Contract

`DIFY_VERSION` is the authoritative upstream release. API and Web provenance
are pinned separately:

- `DIFY_API_IMAGE_DIGEST`: the immutable multi-platform digest of the upstream
  `langgenius/dify-api` base image.
- `DIFY_SOURCE_REVISION`: the Git commit resolved by the upstream tag.
- `DIFY_SOURCE_SHA256`: the SHA-256 of the GitHub source archive used by the Web
  build.
- `NODE_IMAGE_DIGEST`: the authoritative OCI index digest for the Web build and
  runtime base `docker.io/library/node:24.20.0-alpine`.
- `ALPINE_IMAGE_DIGEST`: the authoritative OCI index digest for the Web source
  stage base `docker.io/library/alpine:3.21`.

When changing Dify, update its four provenance files together. When changing a
Web base tag, update its digest file in the same change. The API Dockerfile uses
the digest-pinned base, while the Web Dockerfile uses digest-pinned Node and
Alpine inputs and rejects a source archive that does not match the pinned
checksum. OCI labels distinguish the Web runtime base from its source-stage
base and Dify source provenance.

The API overlay uses the PyJWT and cryptography versions already installed
in the immutable Dify API base image.

Verify the upstream tag, source archive, OCI index digests, and bundled plugin
without building an image:

```bash
./scripts/verify-sources.sh
```

## Validate

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and ShellCheck, then run:

```bash
uv sync --locked --dev
uv run ruff check customizations/api/neurwerk_sso.py customizations/api/neurwerk_settings.py customizations/scripts scripts
uv run ruff format --check customizations/api/neurwerk_sso.py customizations/api/neurwerk_settings.py customizations/scripts scripts
shellcheck deploy.sh scripts/verify-sources.sh
./scripts/verify-sources.sh
```

## Build And Publish

Image construction and publication are intentionally user-operated. You need a
clean Git checkout, Docker with Buildx, Python 3, and GHCR credentials with
`write:packages`. Choose an explicit immutable overlay version beginning with
the upstream version, for example:

```bash
./deploy.sh 1.17.1-kc-v1
```

The prompts default to both API and Web images, `linux/amd64`, and registry
push. A single push choice applies to every selected platform. A local load is
limited to one platform because Docker cannot load a multi-platform image into
the local image store.

The script never creates or publishes `latest`. Before a push it:

1. fetches canonical `origin/main` and requires the clean `HEAD` commit to be
   exactly equal to it;
2. obtains authenticated GHCR `pull,push` tokens for every selected package;
3. opens a temporary empty blob-upload session for every package and requires
   HTTP 202 to prove push permission;
4. attempts to cancel each empty session, but reports cleanup failure as a
   warning because OCI defines cancellation as best-effort and GHCR expires
   unfinished uploads after 10 minutes;
5. requires every final tag lookup to return an explicit absent result; and
6. logs Docker in to `ghcr.io` with the same verified credentials.

Set `GHCR_USERNAME` and `GHCR_TOKEN`, or enter them at the private prompts. The
token needs `write:packages`. The script passes it to `docker login` through
stdin and does not print it, so Buildx and the preflight use the same account.
Docker login runs only after every destination passes preflight. It updates the
`ghcr.io` entry in the configured Docker credential store (or Docker config),
can replace a previously stored GHCR login, and persists after the script exits.
Run `docker logout ghcr.io` afterward if the credential should not remain
stored. Network, authentication, authorization, and tag-response ambiguity
abort before the first build. Cleanup warnings do not block publication because
the accepted upload initiation already proved push access. Existing final tags
are never reused.

On success the script reports each exact tag and resulting content digest;
retain those digests with the release record.

## Publication Atomicity

GHCR does not provide a transaction spanning the API and Web packages. The
script preflights all selected destinations before any build or push, which
prevents predictable partial releases, but the package pushes remain sequential.
A failure after the first package is published can leave a partial release. In
that case, preserve the published immutable tag and rerun only the missing
package from the same clean source commit and version.

If recovery requires a source change, do not complete the partial version from
a different commit. Preserve its published tags, choose a new overlay version,
and publish every required image from the corrected canonical commit.

Tag absence checks also cannot reserve a tag. Exclusive operator coordination
is still required to prevent another publisher racing between preflight and
push; GHCR does not expose a conditional create-only tag operation.

Automation and agents must not run `deploy.sh`, build these images, or publish
them.
